"""incident: add dismiss columns, drop the 'deleted' status, make delete a real delete

Three coupled changes behind the new incident suppression behaviour:

1. `incident.dismiss_mode` / `incident.dismissed_until` — the typed dismiss
   state, mirroring what `lastalert` already carries for alerts. "suppressed"
   is NOT written to `incident.status`; it is derived from these two columns at
   read time (`Incident.get_effective_status`) so a time-boxed dismissal can
   expire on its own clock without a sweeper job rewriting rows.

2. `IncidentStatus.DELETED` is gone, so rows still parked in `status='deleted'`
   are unreachable — nothing can query them by status and nothing will ever
   move them out of it. They are deleted for real here.

3. `incidentenrichment_incident_id_fkey` was NO ACTION, which made a hard
   DELETE of any enriched incident fail with a foreign key violation. Recreated
   ON DELETE CASCADE, matching the CASCADE that `lastalerttoincident` and
   `alerttoincident` already declare. Without this, both the backfill in (2)
   and `delete_incident_by_id` raise on exactly the incidents users care about.

IRREVERSIBLE IN PART: `downgrade()` drops the two columns and restores the
FK's NO ACTION rule, but cannot bring back the rows deleted in (2). Take a
backup if those rows still matter.
