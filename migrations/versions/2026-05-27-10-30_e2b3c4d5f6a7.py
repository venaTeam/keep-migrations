"""Drop misplaced columns from alert (alertenrichment removal — the column-drop migration)

Revision ID: e2b3c4d5f6a7
Revises: d1a2b3c4e5f6
Create Date: 2026-05-27 10:30:00.000000

The misplaced-alert-column drop step of the alertenrichment removal (PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §2).

Drops the mutable cross-occurrence state that Migration 1 incorrectly placed on the
append-only ``alert`` table. This state now lives as typed columns on ``lastalert``
(added by migration c1d2e3f4a5b6) and is read/written there by all three services.

Columns dropped from ``alert``:
  last_received, firing_counter, unresolved_counter, started_at, firing_start_time,
  firing_start_time_since_last_resolved (system tracking -> lastalert.*);
  assignee, dismissed, dismiss_until, note (user state -> lastalert.*);
  incident (denormalized from the AlertToIncident / LastAlertToIncident join — always
  derived via join now).

KEEP on ``alert``: status, severity, description (immutable provider values).

NOTE — ``enriched_fields`` and ``extra_data`` were already dropped by Migration 1, so
they are intentionally NOT listed here.

WARNING — RUN LAST. This is the only irreversible-in-place step of the alertenrichment
removal. It MUST run only after ALL THREE services (keep-event-handler, keep-api-gateway,
keep-workflows) have deployed the code that no longer maps these columns on the ``Alert``
ORM model.
The ``Alert`` SQLModel SELECTs every mapped column; dropping a column the ORM still maps
breaks every alert query. Order: remove from ORM (code deploy) first, drop in DB last
(this migration). See PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §5 (the column-drop gate).

The ``alertenrichment`` table itself is untouched here — it is dropped by a later migration
(when alertenrichment is fully removed).
